### Coding Conventions

Please observe the following coding conventions when contributing to this repo.

#### Naming

- File names: UpperCase (e.g. Footer.js)
- Variables: camelCase (e.g. userCounter)
- Commits: present tense (e.g. "Update footer", "Add header", "Fix bug X")
- Asset names: lowercase (e.g. image.png)
- Branch names: lowercase (e.g. navbar-update)

#### File & folder structure

- Always create a new folder for each component/page
- Create file names relevant to their function (e.g. Footer.js & Footer.css)

#### Git

- Create a new branch for every feature
- Create branch names relevant to the issue that they’re solving
- Don’t merge your own PRs, wait for at least one other people to review it
- Review each other's PRs
- Never commit to master/main directly
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Commit often
- Don’t commit partially working code
- Don't commit package.json and package-lock.json
- Commit code that is directly related to your issue
- Don’t change irrelevant files, make a different issue + branch for them if you need
- Don’t rebase master (it will mess up things for everyone else)
- Pull changes before starting to code (every time)

#### Design

- Make everything look professional & clean (both code, and it’s result if applicable)
