## Contributing

### Setting Up

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed (you can check with `node --version` and `npm --version`)
2. Clone the repository 
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Duplicate the `.env.example` file to create a `.env` file. Change the variables to use your FireBase credentials.
5. Run the project using `npm run start`.

### Coding Conventions

Please observe these coding conventions when contributing to this repo:

#### Naming

- File names: UpperCase (e.g. Footer.js)
- Variables: camelCase (e.g. userCounter)
- Commits: present tense (e.g. "Update footer", "Add header", "Fix bug X")
- Asset names: lowercase (e.g. image.png)
- Branch names: lowercase (e.g. navbar-update)

#### File & folder structure

- Always create a new folder for each component/page
- Create file names relevant to their function (e.g. Footer.js & Footer.css)

#### Git

- Create a new branch for every feature
- Create branch names relevant to the issue that they’re solving
- Don’t merge your own PRs, wait for at least one other people to review it
- Review each other's PRs
- Never commit to master/main directly
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Commit often
- Don’t commit partially working code
- Don't commit package.json and package-lock.json
- Commit code that is directly related to your issue 
- Don’t change irrelevant files, make a different issue + branch for them if you need
- Don’t rebase master (it will mess up things for everyone else)
- Pull changes before starting to code (every time)

#### Design
- Make everything look professional & clean (both code, and it’s result if applicable)


### Available Scripts

*Taken from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
